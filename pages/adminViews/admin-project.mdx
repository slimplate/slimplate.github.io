## Admin Project

AdminProject is a React component that takes in props such as `enableSync` and `onSelect`. It uses the useSlimplate hook to obtain the `usingMonoProject` variable.

```js
function PageDashboard () {
  const { usingMonoProject, monoProject } = useSlimplate()

  const navURL = usingMonoProject
    ? c => hashNavigate(`/${monoProject.userName}/${monoProject.projectName}/${monoProject.branch}/${c.name}`)
    : c => hashNavigate(`/${c.full_name}/${c.branch?.name || c.branch}`)

  return (
    <AdminProject
      enableSync={usingMonoProject}
      onSelect={navURL}
    />
  )
}
```

It is important to know if usingMonoProject is true, the component renders the [AdminProjectMono](/adminViews/admin-project#adminprojectmono) component passing enableSync and onSelect props to it. If usingMonoProject is `false`, the component renders the [AdminProjectMulti](/adminViews/admin-project#adminprojectmulti) component which also passes the onSelect prop to it.

### AdminProjectMono

Takes in props such as `enableSync` and `onSelect`. It uses the `useSlimplate` hook to obtain the `projects` and `status` variables. It also performs a one-time setup of the Git repository for the specified userName and projectName. The purpose of this component is to render the admin collection for a mono-repo project.

```js
<AdminProjectMono enableSync onSelect(console.log))} />
```

<Callout type='warning' emoji='⚠️' />

### AdminProjectMulti

The component renders a table of project information that is obtained from the projects object. It also includes a button to open a modal to create a new project, and buttons to delete, sync, and view a project on GitHub. The onSelect function is used to handle clicks on project rows.

Takes in a prop `onSelect`. It uses the useSlimplate hook to obtain the `projects` and `status` variables.

```js
<AdminProjectMulti onSelect={console.log} />
```
