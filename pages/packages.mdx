### @slimplate/utils
#### Installation

The utils package exports several useful utility functions you can use across your app.
```npm
npm install '@slimplate/utils'
```
#### Usage
```jsx
import { titleize } from '@slimplate/utils'
```

### @slimplate/cfghserver
#### Installation

This is a cloudflare worker that does 2 things:

- Provide ouath callbacks for Github Auth
- Proxy authenticated requests for github files

If you are interested in a vercel version, [slimplate-next-template](https://github.com/slimplate/slimplate-next-template) which has this backend, and a frontend that uses it.

#### Auth

Add a Github OAuth app (under "Developer Settings") set the redirect URL to wherever this is deployed (`https://cfghserver.YOURNAME.workers.dev/api/github/callback`.)

Edit secrets.json to look like this:

```json
{
  "GITHUB_CLIENT": "YOURS",
  "GITHUB_SECRET": "YOURS",
  "REDIRECT_URLS": "http://localhost:5173/"
}
```

`REDIRECT_URLS` is comma-seperated list, and it doesn't have to match GitHub's, just authorized URLs to redirect to (with oauth token.)

Run `npm run deploy` for initial deployment.

Then run `wrangler secret:bulk secrets.json` to push your secrtets to the worker.

In your app, hit `https://cfghserver.YOURNAME.workers.dev/api/github?code=XXXX&redir=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A5173%2F&scope=WHATEVER` to get the oauth token (in get-param `gh`.) `code` comes from the oauth-flow, for the user. Read more [here](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps).

You can see example of using this for Github login [here](https://github.com/slimplate/slimplate-next-template)


#### Proxy

I am using ideas from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@isomorphic-git/cors-proxy).

In your app, use URLs like `https://cfghserver.YOURNAME.workers.dev/api/cors/github.com/slimplate/private-tester.git/info/refs`


### @slimplate/github-git

#### Installation

Represents a single git repo, in browser, from Github 

```npm
npm i slimplate/github-git
```

#### Usage
```jsx
import GithubProject from '@slimplate/github-git'
```
  
```jsx
  const git = new GithubProject(fs, repo, branch, token, user, undefined, corsProxy)
  await git.init()
```
You now have access to tons of great handlers like `push`, `pull` and `clone`. See @slimplate/github-git for more.


### @slimplate/admin-static

This is an example project using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) & [react](https://reactjs.org/) with the UI in [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)/[flowbite](https://flowbite.com/).

Think of this as the central CMS admin for a bunch of [slimplate](https://github.com/slimplate) sites you have in github. It allows you to keep your content in github, and edit it, without a server-side component (you still need a CORS proxy, but that is it.)

#### setup

Deploy [cfghserver](https://github.com/slimplate/cfghserver) on cloudflare, or similar to [this](https://github.com/slimplate/slimplate-next-template/tree/main/pages/api) on vercel. it has a little setup in the README. This will handle github authentication & provide a CORS proxy.

Install deps with `npm i`

Add a line to .env that points to it:

```
VITE_GITHUB_BACKEND=https://mycfghserver.gummicube.workers.dev
```

Test locally with `npm start`

Deploy with `npm run deploy`.


### @slimplate/create-slimplate
This is our CLI Wizard to best help get you started using Slimplate

```jsx
npm init slimplate <MYPROJECT>
```

You can leave off `<MYPROJECT` to be prompted for additional questions. 


### @slimplate/react-flowbite-github

This is our main library for components, hooks, providers, and widgets.

#### Installation
```npm
npm i @slimplate/react-flowbite-github
```

#### Usage
```jsx
import { SlimplateProvider } from '@slimplate/react-flowbite-github'
```
