### Introduction

test

This is an example project that uses [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) & [react](https://reactjs.org/) with the UI in [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)/[flowbite](https://flowbite.com/).

The project aims to provide a central content management system (CMS) admin for multiple [slimplate](https://github.com/slimplate) sites that you have on GitHub. The project allows you to keep your content on GitHub and edit it without requiring a server-side component, except for a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) proxy, which is necessary.

### Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1.  Deploy [cfghserver](https://github.com/slimplate/cfghserver) on cloudflare, or similar to [this](https://github.com/slimplate/slimplate-next-template/tree/main/pages/api) on vercel. Refer to the README file for instructions on how to set it up. This will handle GitHub authentication and provide a CORS proxy.
2.  Install dependencies using the command `npm i`.
3.  Add a line to the `.env` file that points to the deployed cfghserver instance:

<!---->

    VITE_GITHUB_BACKEND=https://mycfghserver.gummicube.workers.dev

4.  Test the project locally using the command `npm start`.
5.  Deploy the project using the command `npm run deploy`.

By following these steps, you will have set up the project and be ready to use it as a central CMS admin for your GitHub-hosted slimplate sites.
